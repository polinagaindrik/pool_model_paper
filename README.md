-  Abstract

-  Introduction

-  General Math
    - [ ] Move to supplement

-  One-Species
    - [x] Remove matrix formulation
    - [ ] Page 3: Remove bullet points in front of pools; mention "the fraction of the population" in
      sentence before
    - [x] Page 4: remove matrix of system (put supplement)
    - [x] Back flow from Growth to Lag pool: make to paragraph "Maxwell type of stress ..."

-  Interaction between Species
    - [ ] Change in supplement too!
    - [ ] Link to supplement for Lotka-Volterra discussion
    - [ ] Mutual inhibition: Rename Toxin variable T to generalized inhibition I such that it matches
      with spatial effects

-  Spatial Effects
    - [x] Page 16: R* = R / R_0 probably remove it
    - [ ] Rename variables: G_max -> N_t and R* -> R
        - [ ] make sure that they match to previous sections
    - [ ] More Citations
    - [ ] Figure 8: Do we need this?
    - [ ] Table 1: Move to supplement
    - [ ] Ensure that we are talking about pool model! (map everything on this new theoretical framework)
    - [ ] Use introductory part in main Introduction as well
    - [ ] Discuss results in text form not only in figure

-  Discussion
    - [ ] difference in lag phase between baranyi-roberts and pool model
    - [ ] mathematical generalization has only linear effects: is this justified? (do we include this?)
    - [ ] how can we describe other effects
        - [ ] more states for different metabolic processes
        - [ ] more pools for more species
        - [ ] other cooperation/inhibition effects
        - [ ] external influences (i.e. put drug into system)
    - [ ] assumptions in setting up ABM model; which details do we include?

-  Conclusion
    - [ ] new theoretical framework: pool model
    - [ ] consistent with ODE models (Baranyi Roberts)
    - [ ] pool model can explain better than known models
    - [ ] account + understand for many other effects such as inhibition and toxins
    - [ ] showed spatial limitation of the model

-  Supplement
    - [ ] Formatting of Supplement subsections
    - [ ] Bundle all existing subsections into "ABM Details"
    - [ ] "General Mathematical Formalism"
        - [ ] Move section 2 here
        - [ ] Move all matrix equations here
        - [ ] Discuss generalized Lotka-Volterra model here extensively!
            - [ ] Christian should probably write this text
