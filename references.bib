  abstract = {This review elucidates the state-of-the-art knowledge about pathogen population heterogeneity and describes the genotypic and phenotypic analyses of persister subpopulations and stress-resistant variants. The molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of persister phenotypes and genetic variants are identified. Zooming in on Listeria monocytogenes, a comparative wholegenome sequence analysis of wild types and variants that enabled the identification of mutations in variants obtained after a single exposure to lethal food-relevant stresses is described. Genotypic and phenotypic features are compared to those for persistent strains isolated from food processing environments. Inactivation kinetics, models used for fitting, and the concept of kinetic modeling\textendash based schemes for detection of variants are presented. Furthermore, robustness and fitness parameters of L. monocytogenes wild type and variants are used to model their performance in food chains. Finally, the impact of stress-resistant variants and persistence in food processing environments on food safety is discussed.},

  abstract = {Description of microbial cell (population) behavior as influenced by dynamically changing environmental conditions intrinsically needs dynamic mathematical models. In the past, major effort has been put into the modeling of microbial growth and inactivation within a constant environment (static models). In the early 1990s, differential equation models (dynamic models) were introduced in the field of predictive microbiology. Here, we present a general dynamic model-building concept describing microbial evolution under dynamic conditions. Starting from an elementary model building block, the model structure can be gradually complexified to incorporate increasing numbers of influencing factors. Based on two case studies, the fundamentals of both macroscopic (population) and microscopic (individual) modeling approaches are revisited. These illustrations deal with the modeling of (i) microbial lag under variable temperature conditions and (ii) interspecies microbial interactions mediated by lactic acid production (product inhibition). Current and future research trends should address the need for (i) more specific measurements at the cell and/or population level, (ii) measurements under dynamic conditions, and (iii) more comprehensive (mechanistically inspired) model structures. In the context of quantitative microbial risk assessment, complexity of the mathematical model must be kept under control. An important challenge for the future is determination of a satisfactory trade-off between predictive power and manageability of predictive microbiology models.}

  abstract = {The use of primary mathematical models with curve fitting software is dramatically changing quantitative food microbiology. The two most widely used primary growth models are the Baranyi and Gompertz models. A three-phase linear model was developed to determine how well growth curves could be described using a simpler model. The model divides bacterial growth curves into three phases: the lag and stationary phases where the specific growth rate is zero (gm=0), and the exponential phase where the logarithm of the bacterial population increases linearly with time (gm=constant). The model has four parameters: No(Log8of initial population density), NMAX(Log8of final population density), tLAG(time when lag phase ends), and tMAX(time when exponential phase ends). A comparison of the linear model was made against the Baranyi and Gompertz models, using established growth data forEscherichia coli0157:H7. The growth curves predicted by the three models showed good agreement. The linear model was more `robust' than the others, especially when experimental data were minimal. The physiological assumptions underlying the linear model are discussed, with particular emphasis on assuring that the model is consistent with bacterial behavior both as individual cells and as populations. It is proposed that the transitional behavior of bacteria at the end of the lag phase can be explained on the basis of biological variability.},

One solution to this problem is if costly cooperative behaviours are directed towards relatives4,5. This idea of kin selection has been hugely influential and applied widely from microorganisms to vertebrates2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. However, a problem arises if there is local competition for resources, because this leads to competition between relatives, reducing selection for cooperation3,11,12,13,14. Here we use an experimental evolution approach to test the effect of the scale of competition, and how it interacts with relatedness. The cooperative trait that we examine is the production of siderophores, iron-scavenging agents, in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa15,16,17. As expected, our results show that higher levels of cooperative siderophore production evolve in the higher relatedness treatments. However, our results also show that more local competition selects for lower levels of siderophore production and that there is a significant interaction between relatedness and the scale of competition, with relatedness having less effect when the scale of competition is more local. More generally, the scale of competition is likely to be of particular importance for the evolution of cooperation in microorganisms, and also the virulence of pathogenic microorganisms, because cooperative traits such as siderophore production have an important role in determining virulence6,9,17,18,19.},

  abstract = {The identifiability properties of the Baranyi model for bacterial growth were investigated, both structurally and applied to real-life data. Using the Taylor-series approach, it was formally proven that the model is structurally identifiable, i.e. it is now ascertained that it is certainly possible to give unique values to all parameters of the model, provided the bacterial growth data are of sufficiently good quality. The model also has acceptable practical identifiability properties in the presence of realistic data, which means that the confidence intervals on the parameter values are reasonable. However, there was a relatively high correlation between the maximum specific growth rate {$\mu$}maxand the suitability indicator h0. An optimal experimental design to improve parameter estimation uncertainty was worked out, using the sampling times of the microbial growth curve as experimental degree of freedom. Using a D-optimal design criterion, it could be shown that the optimal sampling times were concentrated in four time periods (initial, start and end of exponential growth, end of experiment), each providing maximum information on a particular parameter. Because the optimal experimental design requires a priori estimates of the parameters, the propagation of the parameter uncertainty into the experimental design was assessed with a Monte Carlo simulation. In this way, 95\% confidence intervals could be established around the optimal sampling times to be used in the optimal experiment. Based on these intervals, a design was proposed and experimentally validated. The error on the parameter estimates was more than halved, their correlation diminished and the nonlinearity of the result improved.},

One community was a natural assemblage of lake plankton and the other was a model community composed of cultured organisms. As the supply ratio of OC to inorganic P increased, concentrations of dissolved OC increased, concentrations of dissolved P decreased and abundances of phototrophic algae decreased. Abundances of bacteria and phagotrophic organisms did not consistently change with the OC:P supply ratio. The model community was first established with a phototroph (Scenedesmus quadricauda) and bacteria; the steady states of this community were invasible by the mixotroph Ochromonas danica under all OC:P supply ratios used. When OC supply was high, both microbial communities persisted with higher concentrations of dissolved OC when mixed substrates, rather than glucose, were supplied. Otherwise, the effects of organic substrate composition appeared to be secondary to those of the OC:P supply ratio. These experiments confirm some elements of published theory on resource-based interactions among heterotrophic bacteria and phototrophic algae.},

If the ecological opportunity arises (such as when populations are grown in a spatially structured environment, providing multiple niches), intraspecies competition can lead to selection for the diversification of a bacterial population.Under some conditions, cooperation among individuals in a bacterial population can facilitate competition between groups. However, cooperation can be vulnerable to cheating.Bacteria engage in diverse active competitive strategies. These include: accumulating and storing specific nutrients, thereby depriving potential competitors; blocking access to favourable habitats (such as binding sites on a surface) or forcing the dispersal of competitors; motility, especially when directed (chemotaxis); producing antimicrobial toxins; and interfering with competitors' signalling.Microbial systems should be exploited further for testing ecological theories of competition. Additionally, new technologies should aid in moving the study of bacterial competition from the test tube to the natural habitats of microorganisms.},

There exist conditions that permit the stable coexistence of the competitors, provided that (i) the sensitive species is more efficient in exploiting the limiting resource, and (ii) the resistant species removes the inhibitor from the environment. There exists a subset of these conditions wherein the sensitive species can become established if and only if the resistant species is already established. If the resistant species does not remove the inhibitor from the environment, then coexistence of sensitive and resistant species is structurally unstable. If the resistant species produces the inhibitor, then coexistence is dynamically unstable.

  abstract = {The modelling approach presented in this study can be used to predict when interactions between microorganisms in homogenous systems occur. It was tested for the interaction between Lactobacillus curvatus and Enterobacter cloacae. In this binary system, L. curvatus produces lactic acid which decreases the pH in the system. The pH decrease was found to be the main limiting factor of growth of both E. cloacae and L. curvatus. This resulted in E. cloacae reaching its final concentration earlier when compared to its growth in pure culture. The models consisted of a set of first order ordinary differential equations describing the growth, consumption and production rates of both microorganisms. The parameters for these equations were obtained from pure culture studies and from literature. These equations were solved using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. The prediction of growth in mixed culture using parameters from pure culture experiments and literature were close to the experimental data. Both model predictions and experimental validation indicated that interaction occurs when the concentration of L. curvatus reaches 108 cfu/ml. At that moment in time, the pH had decreased to inhibiting levels. These concentrations of microorganisms (108 cfu/ml ) do occur in fermented products where interactions obviously are important. In nonfermented foods however, this level of microorganisms indicate that spoilage has occurred or is about to start. Microbial interactions can therefore be neglected when predicting shelf life or safety of food products in most cases.},

Growth rates of bacteria and C. vulgaris were tested under co-culture conditions to evaluate the effects of concentrations of C. vulgaris and bacteria on their interactions. To test whether the availability of inorganic nutrients, vitamins and trace metals affects the interactions between C. vulgaris and bacteria, experiments were performed with or without the culture medium filtrate of C. vulgaris or bacteria. The results showed that the growth of C. vulgaris was promoted at low concentrations of bacteria (5\texttimes 106 cells/ml), and expressed a positive correlation with the bacteria density, whereas opposite trend was observed for treatments with high bacteria density (10\texttimes 106 cells/ml and 20\texttimes 106 cells/ml). The growth rate of bacteria decreased with the increasing concentrations of C. vulgaris. The growth of bacteria Z-QD08 was inhibited by C. vulgaris through interference competition, while the mechanism for interaction between bacteria Z-QS01 and C. vulgaris was resource competition. The influence of cell density on the interaction between microalgae and bacteria was also discussed. These experiments confirm some elements of published theory on interactions between heterotrophic bacteria and microalgae and suggest that heterotrophic bacteria play an important role in the development of blooms in natural waters.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Lag phase represents the earliest and most poorly understood stage of the bacterial growth cycle. We developed a reproducible experimental system and conducted functional genomic and physiological analyses of a 2-h lag phase in               Salmonella enterica               serovar Typhimurium. Adaptation began within 4 min of inoculation into fresh LB medium with the transient expression of genes involved in phosphate uptake. The main lag-phase transcriptional program initiated at 20 min with the upregulation of 945 genes encoding processes such as transcription, translation, iron-sulfur protein assembly, nucleotide metabolism, LPS biosynthesis, and aerobic respiration. ChIP-chip revealed that RNA polymerase was not ``poised'' upstream of the bacterial genes that are rapidly induced at the beginning of lag phase, suggesting a mechanism that involves               de novo               partitioning of RNA polymerase to transcribe 522 bacterial genes within 4 min of leaving stationary phase. We used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to discover that iron, calcium, and manganese are accumulated by               S               . Typhimurium during lag phase, while levels of cobalt, nickel, and sodium showed distinct growth-phase-specific patterns. The high concentration of iron during lag phase was associated with transient sensitivity to oxidative stress. The study of lag phase promises to identify the physiological and regulatory processes responsible for adaptation to new environments.},

  abstract = {The phyllosphere is densely colonised by microbial communities, despite sparse and heterogeneously distributed resources. The limitation of resources is expected to drive bacterial competition resulting in exclusion or coexistence based on fitness differences and resource overlap between individual colonisers. We studied the impact of resource competition by determining the effects of different bacterial colonisers on the growth of the model epiphyte Pantoea eucalypti 299R (Pe299R). Resource overlap was predicted based on genome-scale metabolic modelling. By combining results of metabolic modelling and pairwise competitions in the Arabidopsis thaliana phyllosphere and in vitro, we found that ten resources sufficed to explain fitness of Pe299R. An effect of both resource overlap and phylogenetic relationships was found on competition outcomes in vitro as well as in the phyllosphere. However, effects of resource competition were much weaker in the phyllosphere when compared to in vitro experiments. When investigating growth dynamics and reproductive success at the single-cell resolution, resource overlap and phylogenetic relationships are only weakly correlated with epiphytic Pe299R reproductive success, indicating that the leaf's spatial heterogeneity mitigates resource competition. Although the correlation is weak, the presence of competitors led to the development of Pe299R subpopulations that experienced different life histories and cell divisions. In some in planta competitions, Pe299R benefitted from the presence of epiphytes despite high resource overlap to the competitor strain suggesting other factors having stronger effects than resource competition. This study provides fundamental insights into how bacterial communities are shaped in heterogeneous environments and a framework to predict competition outcomes.},

This review focuses on the effects of nutrient supplies on the biodegradation of organic matter, and on the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions. Analyses of data from the literature suggest significant effects of nitrogen:phosphorus supply ratios on the microbial decomposition of organic matter, and it is argued that these stoichiometric effects may have important implications for the fate and fluxes of carbon in natural ecosystems. In addition, it is shown that the supplies of nitrogen and phosphorus to the host can strongly influence the outcome of infections in both terrestrial and aquatic plants, suggesting that resource availability and resource supply ratios potentially may have significant effects on the health of many plant communities.},

  abstract = {In the environment, bacteria live in complex multispecies communities. These communities span in scale from small, multicellular aggregates to billions or trillions of cells within the gastrointestinal tract of animals. The dynamics of bacterial communities are determined by pairwise interactions that occur between different species in the community. Though interactions occur between a few cells at a time, the outcomes of these interchanges have ramifications that ripple through many orders of magnitude, and ultimately affect the macroscopic world including the health of host organisms. In this review we cover how bacterial competition influences the structures of bacterial communities. We also emphasize methods and insights garnered from culture-dependent pairwise interaction studies, metagenomic analyses, and modeling experiments. Finally, we argue that the integration of multiple approaches will be instrumental to future understanding of the underlying dynamics of bacterial communities.}

  abstract = {This paper summarises recent trends in predictive modelling of microbial lag phenomena. The lag phase is approached from both a qualitative and a quantitative point of view. First, a definition of lag and an analysis of the prevailing measuring techniques for the determination of lag time is presented. Furthermore, based on experimental results presented in literature, factors influencing the lag phase are discussed. Major modelling approaches concerning lag phase estimation are critically assessed. In predictive microbiology, a two-step modelling approach is used. Primary models describe the evolution of microbial numbers with time and can be subdivided into deterministic and stochastic models. Primary deterministic models, e.g., Baranyi and Roberts [Int. J. Food Microbiol. 23 (1994) 277], Hills and Wright [J. Theor. Biol. 168 (1994) 31] and McKellar [Int. J. Food Microbiol. 36 (1997) 179], describe the evolution of microorganisms, using one single (deterministic) set of model parameters. In stochastic models, e.g., Buchanan et al. [Food Microbiol. 14 (1997) 313], Baranyi [J. Theor. Biol. 192 (1998) 403] and McKellar [J. Appl. Microbiol. 90 (2001) 407], the model parameters are distributed or random variables. Secondary models describe the relation between primary model parameters and influencing factors (e.g., environmental conditions). This survey mainly focusses on the influence of temperature and culture history on the lag phase during growth of bacteria.},
