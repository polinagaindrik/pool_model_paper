	abstract = {Predictive microbiology is a recent area within food microbiology, which studies the responses of microorganisms in foods to environmental factors (e.g., temperature, pH) through mathematical functions. These functions enable scientists to predict the behavior of pathogens and spoilage microorganisms under different combinations of factors. The main goal of predictive models in food science is to assure both food safety and food quality. Predictive models in foods have developed significantly in the last 20 years due to the emergence of powerful computational resources and sophisticated statistical packages. This book presents the concepts, models, most significant advances, and future trends in predictive microbiology. It will discuss the history and basic concepts of predictive microbiology. The most frequently used models will be explained, and the most significant software and databases (e.g., Combase, Sym‚ÄôPrevius) will be reviewed. Quantitative Risk Assessment, which uses predictive modeling to account for the transmission of foodborne pathogens across the food chain, will also be covered. ​},

	abstract = {This paper summarises recent trends in predictive modelling of microbial lag phenomena. The lag phase is approached from both a qualitative and a quantitative point of view. First, a definition of lag and an analysis of the prevailing measuring techniques for the determination of lag time is presented. Furthermore, based on experimental results presented in literature, factors influencing the lag phase are discussed. Major modelling approaches concerning lag phase estimation are critically assessed. In predictive microbiology, a two-step modelling approach is used. Primary models describe the evolution of microbial numbers with time and can be subdivided into deterministic and stochastic models. Primary deterministic models, e.g., Baranyi and Roberts [Int. J. Food Microbiol. 23 (1994) 277], Hills and Wright [J. Theor. Biol. 168 (1994) 31] and McKellar [Int. J. Food Microbiol. 36 (1997) 179], describe the evolution of microorganisms, using one single (deterministic) set of model parameters. In stochastic models, e.g., Buchanan et al. [Food Microbiol. 14 (1997) 313], Baranyi [J. Theor. Biol. 192 (1998) 403] and McKellar [J. Appl. Microbiol. 90 (2001) 407], the model parameters are distributed or random variables. Secondary models describe the relation between primary model parameters and influencing factors (e.g., environmental conditions). This survey mainly focusses on the influence of temperature and culture history on the lag phase during growth of bacteria.},

              Lag phase represents the earliest and most poorly understood stage of the bacterial growth cycle. We developed a reproducible experimental system and conducted functional genomic and physiological analyses of a 2-h lag phase in
              Salmonella enterica
              serovar Typhimurium. Adaptation began within 4 min of inoculation into fresh LB medium with the transient expression of genes involved in phosphate uptake. The main lag-phase transcriptional program initiated at 20 min with the upregulation of 945 genes encoding processes such as transcription, translation, iron-sulfur protein assembly, nucleotide metabolism, LPS biosynthesis, and aerobic respiration. ChIP-chip revealed that RNA polymerase was not “poised” upstream of the bacterial genes that are rapidly induced at the beginning of lag phase, suggesting a mechanism that involves
              de novo
              partitioning of RNA polymerase to transcribe 522 bacterial genes within 4 min of leaving stationary phase. We used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to discover that iron, calcium, and manganese are accumulated by
              S
              . Typhimurium during lag phase, while levels of cobalt, nickel, and sodium showed distinct growth-phase-specific patterns. The high concentration of iron during lag phase was associated with transient sensitivity to oxidative stress. The study of lag phase promises to identify the physiological and regulatory processes responsible for adaptation to new environments.},

	abstract = {The identifiability properties of the Baranyi model for bacterial growth were investigated, both structurally and applied to real-life data. Using the Taylor-series approach, it was formally proven that the model is structurally identifiable, i.e. it is now ascertained that it is certainly possible to give unique values to all parameters of the model, provided the bacterial growth data are of sufficiently good quality. The model also has acceptable practical identifiability properties in the presence of realistic data, which means that the confidence intervals on the parameter values are reasonable. However, there was a relatively high correlation between the maximum specific growth rate μmaxand the suitability indicator h0. An optimal experimental design to improve parameter estimation uncertainty was worked out, using the sampling times of the microbial growth curve as experimental degree of freedom. Using a D-optimal design criterion, it could be shown that the optimal sampling times were concentrated in four time periods (initial, start and end of exponential growth, end of experiment), each providing maximum information on a particular parameter. Because the optimal experimental design requires a priori estimates of the parameters, the propagation of the parameter uncertainty into the experimental design was assessed with a Monte Carlo simulation. In this way, 95\% confidence intervals could be established around the optimal sampling times to be used in the optimal experiment. Based on these intervals, a design was proposed and experimentally validated. The error on the parameter estimates was more than halved, their correlation diminished and the nonlinearity of the result improved.},

	abstract = {Description of microbial cell (population) behavior as influenced by dynamically changing environmental conditions intrinsically needs dynamic mathematical models. In the past, major effort has been put into the modeling of microbial growth and inactivation within a constant environment (static models). In the early 1990s, differential equation models (dynamic models) were introduced in the field of predictive microbiology. Here, we present a general dynamic model-building concept describing microbial evolution under dynamic conditions. Starting from an elementary model building block, the model structure can be gradually complexified to incorporate increasing numbers of influencing factors. Based on two case studies, the fundamentals of both macroscopic (population) and microscopic (individual) modeling approaches are revisited. These illustrations deal with the modeling of (i) microbial lag under variable temperature conditions and (ii) interspecies microbial interactions mediated by lactic acid production (product inhibition). Current and future research trends should address the need for (i) more specific measurements at the cell and/or population level, (ii) measurements under dynamic conditions, and (iii) more comprehensive (mechanistically inspired) model structures. In the context of quantitative microbial risk assessment, complexity of the mathematical model must be kept under control. An important challenge for the future is determination of a satisfactory trade-off between predictive power and manageability of predictive microbiology models.},

We discuss the differences between these two quorum-sensing systems and the differences between them and other paradigmatic bacterial signal transduction systems. We argue that the Vibrio quorum-sensing systems are optimally designed to precisely translate extracellular autoinducer information into internal changes in gene expression.

	abstract = {The use of primary mathematical models with curve fitting software is dramatically changing quantitative food microbiology. The two most widely used primary growth models are the Baranyi and Gompertz models. A three-phase linear model was developed to determine how well growth curves could be described using a simpler model. The model divides bacterial growth curves into three phases: the lag and stationary phases where the specific growth rate is zero (gm=0), and the exponential phase where the logarithm of the bacterial population increases linearly with time (gm=constant). The model has four parameters: No(Log8of initial population density), NMAX(Log8of final population density), tLAG(time when lag phase ends), and tMAX(time when exponential phase ends). A comparison of the linear model was made against the Baranyi and Gompertz models, using established growth data forEscherichia coli0157:H7. The growth curves predicted by the three models showed good agreement. The linear model was more ‘robust' than the others, especially when experimental data were minimal. The physiological assumptions underlying the linear model are discussed, with particular emphasis on assuring that the model is consistent with bacterial behavior both as individual cells and as populations. It is proposed that the transitional behavior of bacteria at the end of the lag phase can be explained on the basis of biological variability.},

One community was a natural assemblage of lake plankton and the other was a model community composed of cultured organisms. As the supply ratio of OC to inorganic P increased, concentrations of dissolved OC increased, concentrations of dissolved P decreased and abundances of phototrophic algae decreased. Abundances of bacteria and phagotrophic organisms did not consistently change with the OC:P supply ratio. The model community was first established with a phototroph (Scenedesmus quadricauda) and bacteria; the steady states of this community were invasible by the mixotroph Ochromonas danica under all OC:P supply ratios used. When OC supply was high, both microbial communities persisted with higher concentrations of dissolved OC when mixed substrates, rather than glucose, were supplied. Otherwise, the effects of organic substrate composition appeared to be secondary to those of the OC:P supply ratio. These experiments confirm some elements of published theory on resource-based interactions among heterotrophic bacteria and phototrophic algae.},

To test whether the availability of inorganic nutrients, vitamins and trace metals affects the interactions between C. vulgaris and bacteria, experiments were performed with or without the culture medium filtrate of C. vulgaris or bacteria. The results showed that the growth of C. vulgaris was promoted at low concentrations of bacteria (5×106 cells/ml), and expressed a positive correlation with the bacteria density, whereas opposite trend was observed for treatments with high bacteria density (10×106 cells/ml and 20×106 cells/ml). The growth rate of bacteria decreased with the increasing concentrations of C. vulgaris. The growth of bacteria Z-QD08 was inhibited by C. vulgaris through interference competition, while the mechanism for interaction between bacteria Z-QS01 and C. vulgaris was resource competition. The influence of cell density on the interaction between microalgae and bacteria was also discussed.

However, cooperation can be vulnerable to cheating.Bacteria engage in diverse active competitive strategies. These include: accumulating and storing specific nutrients, thereby depriving potential competitors; blocking access to favourable habitats (such as binding sites on a surface) or forcing the dispersal of competitors; motility, especially when directed (chemotaxis); producing antimicrobial toxins; and interfering with competitors' signalling.Microbial systems should be exploited further for testing ecological theories of competition. Additionally, new technologies should aid in moving the study of bacterial competition from the test tube to the natural habitats of microorganisms.},

	abstract = {The phyllosphere is densely colonised by microbial communities, despite sparse and heterogeneously distributed resources. The limitation of resources is expected to drive bacterial competition resulting in exclusion or coexistence based on fitness differences and resource overlap between individual colonisers. We studied the impact of resource competition by determining the effects of different bacterial colonisers on the growth of the model epiphyte Pantoea eucalypti 299R (Pe299R). Resource overlap was predicted based on genome-scale metabolic modelling. By combining results of metabolic modelling and pairwise competitions in the Arabidopsis thaliana phyllosphere and in vitro, we found that ten resources sufficed to explain fitness of Pe299R. An effect of both resource overlap and phylogenetic relationships was found on competition outcomes in vitro as well as in the phyllosphere. However, effects of resource competition were much weaker in the phyllosphere when compared to in vitro experiments. When investigating growth dynamics and reproductive success at the single-cell resolution, resource overlap and phylogenetic relationships are only weakly correlated with epiphytic Pe299R reproductive success, indicating that the leaf’s spatial heterogeneity mitigates resource competition. Although the correlation is weak, the presence of competitors led to the development of Pe299R subpopulations that experienced different life histories and cell divisions. In some in planta competitions, Pe299R benefitted from the presence of epiphytes despite high resource overlap to the competitor strain suggesting other factors having stronger effects than resource competition. This study provides fundamental insights into how bacterial communities are shaped in heterogeneous environments and a framework to predict competition outcomes.},

	abstract = {Explaining altruistic cooperation is one of the greatest challenges for evolutionary biology1,2,3. One solution to this problem is if costly cooperative behaviours are directed towards relatives4,5. This idea of kin selection has been hugely influential and applied widely from microorganisms to vertebrates2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. However, a problem arises if there is local competition for resources, because this leads to competition between relatives, reducing selection for cooperation3,11,12,13,14. Here we use an experimental evolution approach to test the effect of the scale of competition, and how it interacts with relatedness. The cooperative trait that we examine is the production of siderophores, iron-scavenging agents, in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa15,16,17. As expected, our results show that higher levels of cooperative siderophore production evolve in the higher relatedness treatments. However, our results also show that more local competition selects for lower levels of siderophore production and that there is a significant interaction between relatedness and the scale of competition, with relatedness having less effect when the scale of competition is more local. More generally, the scale of competition is likely to be of particular importance for the evolution of cooperation in microorganisms, and also the virulence of pathogenic microorganisms, because cooperative traits such as siderophore production have an important role in determining virulence6,9,17,18,19.},

Resource and inhibitor are both derived from external sources. These inputs, and all other model parameters, are assumed to be constant in space and time. There exist conditions that permit the stable coexistence of the competitors, provided that (i) the sensitive species is more efficient in exploiting the limiting resource, and (ii) the resistant species removes the inhibitor from the environment. There exists a subset of these conditions wherein the sensitive species can become established if and only if the resistant species is already established. If the resistant species does not remove the inhibitor from the environment, then coexistence of sensitive and resistant species is structurally unstable. If the resistant species produces the inhibitor, then coexistence is dynamically unstable.

	abstract = {The modelling approach presented in this study can be used to predict when interactions between microorganisms in homogenous systems occur. It was tested for the interaction between Lactobacillus curvatus and Enterobacter cloacae. In this binary system, L. curvatus produces lactic acid which decreases the pH in the system. The pH decrease was found to be the main limiting factor of growth of both E. cloacae and L. curvatus. This resulted in E. cloacae reaching its final concentration earlier when compared to its growth in pure culture. The models consisted of a set of first order ordinary differential equations describing the growth, consumption and production rates of both microorganisms. The parameters for these equations were obtained from pure culture studies and from literature. These equations were solved using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. The prediction of growth in mixed culture using parameters from pure culture experiments and literature were close to the experimental data. Both model predictions and experimental validation indicated that interaction occurs when the concentration of L. curvatus reaches 108 cfu/ml. At that moment in time, the pH had decreased to inhibiting levels. These concentrations of microorganisms (108 cfu/ml ) do occur in fermented products where interactions obviously are important. In nonfermented foods however, this level of microorganisms indicate that spoilage has occurred or is about to start. Microbial interactions can therefore be neglected when predicting shelf life or safety of food products in most cases.},

It used to be assumed that bacteria and other microorganisms lived relatively independent unicellular lives, without the cooperative behaviors that have provoked so much interest in mammals, birds, and insects. However, a rapidly expanding body of research has completely overturned this idea, showing that microbes indulge in a variety of social behaviors involving complex systems of cooperation, communication, and synchronization. Work in this area has already provided some elegant experimental tests of social evolutionary theory, demonstrating the importance of factors such as relatedness, kin discrimination, competition between relatives, and enforcement of cooperation. Our aim here is to review these social behaviors, emphasizing the unique opportunities they offer for testing existing evolutionary theory as well as highlighting the novel theoretical problems that they pose.},

Here we describe an evolutionary transition that occurs in experimental populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens propagated in a spatially heterogeneous environment17. Cooperating groups are formed by over-production of an adhesive polymer18, which causes the interests of individuals to align with those of the group. The costs and benefits of cooperation, plus evolutionary susceptibility to defecting genotypes, were analysed to determine conformation to theory1,3,12. Cooperation was costly to individuals, but beneficial to the group. Defecting genotypes evolved in populations founded by the cooperating type and were fitter in the presence of this type than in its absence. In the short term, defectors sabotaged the viability of the group; but these findings nevertheless show that transitions to higher orders of complexity are readily achievable, provide insights into the selective conditions, and facilitate experimental analysis of the evolution of individuality.},

Oligotrophic environments and competition among microorganisms force bacteria to be able to adapt quickly to rough and changing situations. A particular lifestyle composed of continuous cycles of growth and starvation is commonly referred to as feast and famine. Bacteria have developed many different mechanisms to survive in nutrient-depleted and harsh environments, varying from producing a more resistant vegetative cell to complex developmental programmes. As a consequence of prolonged starvation, certain bacterial species enter a dynamic nonproliferative state in which continuous cycles of growth and death occur until ‘better times’ come (restoration of favourable growth conditions). In the laboratory, microbiologists approach famine situations using batch culture conditions. The entrance to the stationary phase is a very regulated process governed by the alternative sigma factor RpoS. Induction of RpoS changes the gene expression pattern, aiming to produce a more resistant cell. The study of stationary phase revealed very interesting phenomena such as the growth advantage in stationary phase phenotype. This review focuses on some of the interesting responses of gram-negative bacteria when they enter the fascinating world of stationary phase.},

Understanding how the microbiota confers resistance against enteric pathogens and how antibiotics disrupt that resistance is key to the prevention and cure of intestinal infections. We present a novel method to infer microbial community ecology directly from time-resolved metagenomics. This method extends generalized Lotka–Volterra dynamics to account for external perturbations. Data from recent experiments on antibiotic-mediated Clostridium difficile infection is analyzed to quantify microbial interactions, commensal-pathogen interactions, and the effect of the antibiotic on the community. Stability analysis reveals that the microbiota is intrinsically stable, explaining how antibiotic perturbations and C. difficile inoculation can produce catastrophic shifts that persist even after removal of the perturbations. Importantly, the analysis suggests a subnetwork of bacterial groups implicated in protection against C. difficile. Due to its generality, our method can be applied to any high-resolution ecological time-series data to infer community structure and response to external stimuli.},

Specifically, deciphering how microbial species in a community interact with each other and their environment can elucidate mechanisms of disease, a problem typically investigated using tools from community ecology. Yet, such methods require measurements of absolute densities, whereas typical datasets only provide estimates of relative abundances. Here, we systematically investigate models of microbial dynamics in the simplex of relative abundances. We derive a new nonlinear dynamical system for microbial dynamics, termed “compositional” Lotka-Volterra (cLV), unifying approaches using generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV) equations from community ecology and compositional data analysis. On three real datasets, we demonstrate that cLV recapitulates interactions between relative abundances implied by gLV. Moreover, we show that cLV is as accurate as gLV in forecasting microbial trajectories in terms of relative abundances. We further compare cLV to two other models of relative abundance dynamics motivated by common assumptions in the literature—a linear model in a log-ratio transformed space, and a linear model in the space of relative abundances—and provide evidence that cLV more accurately describes community trajectories over time. Finally, we investigate when information about direct effects can be recovered from relative data that naively provide information about only indirect effects. Our results suggest that strong effects may be recoverable from relative data, but more subtle effects are challenging to identify.},

Subsequently, the effects on ecosystem functioning of yeast omissions in the microbial community were evaluated. It was found both in the Lotka-Volterra model and in the omission study that negative interactions occurred between yeasts. Yarrowia lipolytica inhibited mycelial expansion of Geotrichum candidum, whereas Y. lipolytica and G. candidum inhibited Debaryomyces hansenii cell viability during the stationary phase. However, the mechanisms involved in these interactions remain unclear. It was also shown that yeast-bacterium interactions played a significant role in the establishment of this multispecies ecosystem on the cheese surface. Yeasts were key species in bacterial development, but their influences on the bacteria differed. It appeared that the growth of Arthrobacter arilaitensis or Hafnia alvei relied less on a specific yeast function because these species dominated the bacterial flora, regardless of which yeasts were present in the ecosystem. For other bacteria, such as Leucobacter sp. or Brevibacterium aurantiacum, growth relied on a specific yeast, i.e., G. candidum. Furthermore, B. aurantiacum, Corynebacterium casei, and Staphylococcus xylosus showed reduced colonization capacities in comparison with the other bacteria in this model cheese. Bacterium-bacterium interactions could not be clearly identified.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms form various ecological relationships, ranging from mutualism to competition, that in addition to other factors (such as niche preferences and random processes) shape microbial abundances. Recently, network inference techniques have frequently been applied to microbial presence–absence or abundance data to detect significant patterns of co-presence and mutual exclusion between taxa and to represent them as a network.In addition to predicting links between taxa and between environmental traits and taxa, the analysis of microbial association networks reveals niches, points out keystone species and indicates alternative community configurations.However, several pitfalls in the construction and interpretation of these networks exist, ranging from data normalization to multiple test correction. Thorough evaluation is needed to determine the best-performing network inference technique.Recent advances in the cultivation of unknown microorganisms, combinatorial labelling and parallel cultivation may soon allow systematic co-culturing and perturbation (that is, species removal) experiments.Interaction strengths that have been obtained from static networks or that have been measured experimentally can serve as inputs for dynamic models of microbial communities, which in turn can simulate the behaviour of the system in various conditions. In the long run, dynamic models could help to engineer microbial communities.The theory of dynamic systems can contribute to our understanding of microbial communities. For instance, alternative community states can arise as a consequence of system dynamics without being driven by environmental differences.},

We developed a generalizable model-guided framework to predict higher-dimensional consortia from time-resolved measurements of lower-order assemblages. This method was employed to decipher microbial interactions in a diverse human gut microbiome synthetic community. We show that pairwise interactions are major drivers of multi-species community dynamics, as opposed to higher-order interactions. The inferred ecological network exhibits a high proportion of negative and frequent positive interactions. Ecological drivers and responsive recipient species were discovered in the network. Our model demonstrated that a prevalent positive and negative interaction topology enables robust coexistence by implementing a negative feedback loop that balances disparities in monospecies fitness levels. We show that negative interactions could generate history-dependent responses of initial species proportions that frequently do not originate from bistability. Measurements of extracellular metabolites illuminated the metabolic capabilities of monospecies and potential molecular basis of microbial interactions. In sum, these methods defined the ecological roles of major human-associated intestinal species and illuminated design principles of microbial communities.},

In these models, an individual receives additive fitness effects from pairwise interactions with each species in the community ('additivity assumption'). All pairwise interactions are typically represented by a single equation where parameters reflect signs and strengths of fitness effects ('universality assumption'). Here, we show that a single equation fails to qualitatively capture diverse pairwise microbial interactions. We build mechanistic reference models for two microbial species engaging in commonly-found chemical-mediated interactions, and attempt to derive pairwise models. Different equations are appropriate depending on whether a mediator is consumable or reusable, whether an interaction is mediated by one or more mediators, and sometimes even on quantitative details of the community (e.g. relative fitness of the two species, initial conditions). Our results, combined with potential violation of the additivity assumption in many-species communities, suggest that pairwise modeling will often fail to predict microbial dynamics.},

Our investigation reveals that species–metabolite interaction (SMI) modelling is better able to capture emergent behaviour in community composition dynamics than direct species–species modelling. Using publicly available data, we examine the ability of species–species models and species–metabolite models to predict trio growth experiments from the outcomes of pair growth experiments. We compare quadratic species–species interaction models and quadratic SMI models and conclude that only species–metabolite models have the necessary complexity to explain a wide variety of interdependent growth outcomes. We also show that general species–species interaction models cannot match the patterns observed in community growth dynamics, whereas species–metabolite models can.

To predict the number of organisms as a function of temperature and time, it is essential to model the growth as a function of temperature. The temperature is often not constant in various stages of distribution. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of shifts in temperature. The suitability and usefulness of several models to describe the growth of Lactobacillus plantarum with fluctuating temperatures was evaluated. It can be assumed that temperature shifts within the lag phase can be handled by adding relative parts of the lag time to be completed and that temperature shifts within the exponential phase result in no lag phase. With these assumptions, the kinetic behavior of temperature shift experiments was reasonably well predicted, and this hypothesis was accepted statistically in 73\% of the cases. Only shifts of temperature around the minimum temperature for growth showed very large deviations from the model prediction. The best results were obtained with the assumption that a temperature shift (within the lag phase as well as within the exponential phase) results in an additional lag phase. This hypothesis was accepted statistically in 93\% of the cases. The length of the additional lag phase is one-fourth of the lag time normally found at the temperature after the shift.},

We focus on the case of the cyanobacterial crust in drylands, exposed to severe water shortage, and compare the fate of ideal populations that are, respectively, capable or incapable of becoming dormant. The results of the simple model introduced here indicate that under a constant, even though low, supply of water the dormant strategy does not provide any benefit and it can, instead, decrease the chances of survival of the population. The situation is reversed for highly intermittent external stress, due to the presence of prolonged periods of dry conditions intermingled with short periods of intense precipitation. In this case, dormancy allows for the survival of the population during the dry periods. In contrast, bacteria that are incapable of turning into a dormant state cannot overcome the difficult times. The model also rationalizes why dormant bacteria, such as those composing the cyanobacterial crust in the desert, are extremely sensitive to other disturbances, such as trampling cattle.},

By entering a reversible state of low metabolic activity, dormant individuals become members of a seed bank, which can determine community dynamics in future generations. Although microbiologists have documented dormancy in both clinical and natural settings, the importance of seed banks for the diversity and functioning of microbial communities remains untested. Here, we develop a theoretical model demonstrating that microbial communities are structured by environmental cues that trigger dormancy. A molecular survey of lake ecosystems revealed that dormancy plays a more important role in shaping bacterial communities than eukaryotic microbial communities. The proportion of dormant bacteria was relatively low in productive ecosystems but accounted for up to 40\% of taxon richness in nutrient-poor systems. Our simulations and empirical data suggest that regional environmental cues and dormancy synchronize the composition of active communities across the landscape while decoupling active microbes from the total community at local scales. Furthermore, we observed that rare bacterial taxa were disproportionately active relative to common bacterial taxa, suggesting that microbial rank-abundance curves are more dynamic than previously considered. We propose that repeated transitions to and from the seed bank may help maintain the high levels of microbial biodiversity that are observed in nearly all ecosystems.},

In the late 1970s, several easily performed noncultural methods (Zimmerman et al., 1978; Kogure et al., 1979) for determining cell viability allowed confirmation of earlier microautoradiographic studies (e.g., Hoppe, 1976) which demonstrated that many of these nonculturable cells are indeed viable and able to actively metabolize. Such studies led to the further realization that some bacteria, in response to certain environmental stresses, may lose the ability to grow on media on which they are routinely cultured, while remaining viable. This state is of considerable interest to our understanding of microbial ecology. It is of special concern when considering release into the environment of genetically engineered microorganisms, and for those indicator bacteria (e.g., coliforms) and human pathogens which enter this nonculturable state and are thus not detectable through routine bacteriological procedures.},

These attributes include apparent cell integrity, the possession of some form of measurable cellular activity and the apparent capacity to regain culturability. We review the evidence relating to putative VBNC cells and stress our view that most of the reports claiming a return to culturability have failed to exclude the regrowth of a limited number of cells which had never lost culturability. We argue that failure to differentiate clearly between use of the terms ‘viability’ and ‘culturability’ in an operational versus a conceptual sense is fuelling the current debate, and conclude with a number of proposals that are designed to help clarify the major issues involved.

This approach allows us to study population behaviours that emerge from the interaction between individuals and their environment. NUFEB is built on top of the classical molecular dynamics simulator LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator), which we extended with IbM features. A wide range of biological, physical and chemical processes are implemented to explicitly model microbial systems, with particular emphasis on biofilms. NUFEB is fully parallelised and allows for the simulation of large numbers of microbes (107 individuals and beyond). The parallelisation is based on a domain decomposition scheme that divides the domain into multiple sub-domains which are distributed to different processors. NUFEB also offers a collection of post-processing routines for the visualisation and analysis of simulation output. In this article, we give an overview of NUFEB’s functionalities and implementation details. We provide examples that illustrate the type of microbial systems NUFEB can be used to model and simulate.},

In particular, we find that the velocity depends on the elastic modulus of bacteria or their stickiness to the surface. Interestingly, we predict that the radius of an incompressible, strictly two-dimensional colony cannot grow linearly in time, unless it develops branches.

This question is relevant to the dynamics of general self-propelled particle systems, biological self-organization, and active fluids. Bacteria provide a tractable system to address this question, because bacteria are simple and their behavior is relatively easy to control. In this mini review we will focus on a special form of bacterial collective motion, i.e., bacterial swarming in two dimensions. We will introduce some organization principles known in bacterial swarming and discuss potential means of controlling its dynamics.

          a viscous fluid. Self-propulsion is modelled by a couple of forces of same intensity and
          opposite direction applied on the rigid bacterial body and on an associated region in the
          fluid representing the flagellar bundle. The method for solving the fluid flow and the
          motion of the bacteria is based on a variational formulation written on the whole domain,
          strongly coupling the fluid and the rigid particle problems: rigid motion is enforced by
          penalizing the strain rate tensor on the rigid domain, while incompressibility is treated
          by duality. This model allows to achieve an accurate description of fluid motion and
          hydrodynamic interactions in moderate to concentrated active suspensions. A mesoscopic
          model is also used, in which the size of the bacteria is supposed to be much smaller than
          the elements of fluid: the perturbation of the fluid due to propulsion and motion of the
          swimmers is neglected, and the fluid is only subjected to the buoyant forcing induced by
          the presence of the bacteria, which are denser than the fluid. Although this model does
          not accurately take into account hydrodynamic interactions, it is able to reproduce
          complex collective dynamics observed in concentrated bacterial suspensions, such as
          bioconvection. From a mathematical point of view, both models lead to a minimization
          problem which is solved with a standard Finite Element Method. In order to ensure
          robustness, a projection algorithm is used to deal with contacts between particles. We
          also reproduce chemotactic behaviour driven by oxygen: an advection-diffusion equation on
          the oxygen concentration is solved in the fluid domain, with a source term accounting for
          oxygen consumption by the bacteria. The orientations of the individual bacteria are
          subjected to random changes, with a frequency that depends on the surrounding oxygen
          concentration, in order to favor the direction of the concentration gradient.},

A key open question concerns varying mechanisms by which reorientation occurs. We combine mathematical modelling with analysis of a large tracking dataset to study the poorly understood reorientation mechanism in the monoflagellate species Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The flagellum on this species rotates counterclockwise to propel the bacterium, periodically ceasing rotation to enable reorientation. When rotation restarts the cell body usually points in a new direction. It has been assumed that the new direction is simply the result of Brownian rotation. We consider three variants of a self-propelled particle model of bacterial motility. The first considers rotational diffusion only, corresponding to a non-chemotactic mutant strain. Two further models incorporate stochastic reorientations, describing ‘run-and-tumble’ motility. We derive expressions for key summary statistics and simulate each model using a stochastic computational algorithm. We also discuss the effect of cell geometry on rotational diffusion. Working with a previously published tracking dataset, we compare predictions of the models with data on individual stopping events in R. sphaeroides. This provides strong evidence that this species undergoes some form of active reorientation rather than simple reorientation by Brownian rotation.},

BSim includes reference implementations of many bacterial traits to enable the quick development of new models partially built from existing ones. Unlike existing modeling tools, BSim fully considers spatial aspects of a model allowing for the description of intricate micro-scale structures, enabling the modeling of bacterial behavior in more realistic three-dimensional, complex environments. The new opportunities that BSim opens are illustrated through several diverse examples covering: spatial multicellular computing, modeling complex environments, population dynamics of the lac operon, and the synchronization of genetic oscillators. BSim is open source software that is freely available from http://bsim-bccs.sf.net and distributed under the Open Source Initiative (OSI) recognized MIT license.

The observation is compared with computer simulation based on analysis of relevant physical factors, including electrostatics, van der Waals force, hydrodynamics, and Brownian motion. The simulation reproduces the experimental findings and reveals contribution from fluctuations of the cell orientation beyond the resolution of present observation. Coupled with hydrodynamic interaction between the bacterium and the boundary surface, the fluctuations in distance and orientation subsequently lead to variation of the swimming speed and local radius of curvature of swimming trajectory.

Naturally contaminated samples were used to validate this approach by considering the effect of the food microbiota. Three groups of bacteria were inoculated on irradiated samples, in mono- and in co-culture experiments (n = 1152): Brochothrix thermosphacta, Leuconostoc gelidum, and Pseudomonas spp. (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas fragi). Samples were stored in two food packaging [food wrap and modified atmosphere packaging (CO2 30\%/O2 70\%)] at three isothermal conditions (4, 8, and 12°C). Analysis was carried out by using both 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and classical microbiology in order to estimate bacterial counts during the storage period. Growth parameters were obtained by fitting primary (Baranyi) and secondary (square root) models. The food packaging shows the highest impact on bacterial growth rates, which in turn have the strongest influence on the shelf life of food products. Based on these results, a three-spoilage species interaction model was developed by using the modified Jameson-effect model and the Lotka Volterra (prey–predator) model. The modified Jameson-effect model showed slightly better performances, with 40–86\% out of the observed counts falling into the Acceptable Simulation Zone (ASZ). It only concerns 14–48\% for the prey–predator approach. These results can be explained by the fact that the dynamics of experimental and validation datasets seems to follow a Jameson behavior. On the other hand, the Lotka Volterra model is based on complex interaction factors, which are included in highly variable intervals. More datasets are probably needed to obtained reliable factors, and so better model fittings, especially for three- or more-spoilage species interaction models. Further studies are also needed to better understand the interaction of spoilage bacteria between them and in the presence of natural microbiota.},

In particular, it is unclear under what conditions the benefits of toxic killing outweigh the metabolic costs involved. A killer advantage has been suggested to rely on local competitive interactions where the benefits of killing accrue to the toxin producer preferentially, but this notion has little empirical support. In addition, contrasting predictions exist about the effect of resource abundance on the benefits of toxin production; this benefit should either be highest when resources are abundant and metabolic costs are relatively low or when resources are scarce and toxic killing is a ‘last resort strategy’ to obtain nutrients. Here, we test these predictions for one aspect of competitive ability, that is, the ability of toxin producers to invade a population of sensitive non-producers from a low initial frequency. We use competition experiments between isogenic K1 toxin-producing and non-producing strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where we manipulate dispersal under two extreme nutrient conditions: one environment with and the other without replenishment of nutrients. We find that toxin production is beneficial when dispersal is limited under both nutrient conditions, but only when resources are abundant these outweigh its cost and allow invasion of the producer.},

However, we also show that in a soft agar matrix, a structured habitat, the colicinogenic bacteria have an advantage even when initially rare (frequencies as low as 10(-6)). These contrasting outcomes are attributed to the colicinogenic bacteria's lower intrinsic growth rate relative to the sensitive bacteria and the different manner in which bacteria and resources are partitioned in the two types of habitats. Bacteria in a liquid culture exist as randomly distributed individuals and the killing of sensitive bacteria by the colicin augments the amount of resource available to the colicinogenic bacteria to an extent identical to that experienced by the surviving sensitive bacteria. On the other hand, the bacteria in a soft agar matrix exist as single-clone colonies. As the colicinogenic colonies release colicin, they kill neighboring sensitive bacteria and form an inhibition zone around themselves. By this action, they increase the concentration of resources around themselves and overcome their growth rate disadvantage. We suggest that structured habitats are more favorable for the evolution of colicinogenic bacteria.},

	abstract = {Summary: The generic, quantitative, spatially explicit, individual-based model BacSim was developed to simulate growth and behaviour of bacteria. The potential of this approach is in relating the properties of microscopic entities – cells – to the properties of macroscopic, complex systems such as biofilms. Here, the growth of a single
              Escherichia coli
              cell into a colony was studied. The object-oriented program BacSim is an extension of Gecko, an ecosystem dynamics model which uses the Swarm toolkit for multi-agent simulations. The model describes bacterial properties including substrate uptake, metabolism, maintenance, cell division and death at the individual cell level. With the aim of making the model easily applicable to various bacteria under different conditions, the model uses as few as eight readily obtainable parameters which can be randomly varied. For substrate diffusion, a two-dimensional diffusion lattice is used. For growth-rate-dependent cell size variation, a conceptual model of cell division proposed by Donachie was examined. A mechanistic version of the Donachie model led to unbalanced growth at higher growth rates, whereas including a minimum period between subsequent replication initiations ensured balanced growth only if this period was unphysiologically long. Only a descriptive version of the Donachie model predicted cell sizes correctly. For maintenance, the Herbert model (constant specific rate of biomass consumption) and for substrate uptake, the Michaelis-Menten or the Best equations were implemented. The simulator output faithfully reproduced all input parameters. Growth characteristics when maintenance and uptake rates were proportional to either cell mass or surface area are compared. The authors propose a new generic measure of growth synchrony to quantify the loss of synchrony due to random variation of cell parameters or spatial heterogeneity. Variation of the maximal uptake rate completely desynchronizes the simulated culture but variation of the volume-at-division does not. A new measure for spatial heterogeneity is introduced: the standard deviation of substrate concentrations as experienced by the cells. Spatial heterogeneity desynchronizes population growth by subdividing the population into parts synchronously growing at different rates. At a high enough spatial heterogeneity, the population appears to grow completely asynchronously.},

	abstract = {Microbial communities are complex living systems that populate the planet with diverse functions and are increasingly harnessed for practical human needs. To deepen the fundamental understanding of their organization and functioning as well as to facilitate their engineering for applications, mathematical modeling has played an increasingly important role. Agent-based models represent a class of powerful quantitative frameworks for investigating microbial communities because of their individualistic nature in describing cells, mechanistic characterization of molecular and cellular processes, and intrinsic ability to produce emergent system properties. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in agent-based modeling of microbial communities. It surveys the state-of-the-art algorithms employed to simulate intracellular biomolecular events, single-cell behaviors, intercellular interactions, and interactions between cells and their environments that collectively serve as the driving forces of community behaviors. It also highlights three lines of applications of agent-based modeling, namely, the elucidation of microbial range expansion and colony ecology, the design of synthetic gene circuits and microbial populations for desired behaviors, and the characterization of biofilm formation and dispersal. The review concludes with a discussion of existing challenges, including the computational cost of the modeling, and potential mitigation strategies.},

	abstract = {A new member of the family of growth models described by Baranyi et al. (1993a) is introduced in which the physiological state of the cells is represented by a single variable. The duration of lag is determined by the value of that variable at inoculation and by the post-inoculation environment. When the subculturing procedure is standardized, as occurs in laboratory experiments leading to models, the physiological state of the inoculum is relatively constant and independent of subsequent growth conditions. It is shown that, with cells with the same pre-inoculation history, the product of the lag parameter and the maximum specific growth rate is a simple transformation of the initial physiological state. An important consequence is that it is sufficient to estimate this constant product and to determine how the environmental factors define the specific growth rate without modelling the environment dependence of the lag separately. Assuming that the specific growth rate follows the environmental changes instantaneously, the new model can also describe the bacterial growth in an environment where the factors, such as temperature, pH and aw, change with time.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: This article discusses the possibilities to study relevant quality aspects of food, such as color, nutrient content, and safety, in a quantitative way via mathematical models. These quality parameters are governed by chemical, biochemical, microbial, and physical changes. It is argued that the modeling of such quality aspects is in fact kinetic modeling. Therefore, attention is paid to chemical kinetics, and its possibilities and limitations are discussed when applied to changes occurring in foods. The discussion is illustrated with examples from the literature. A major difficulty is that principles from chemical kinetics are strictly speaking only valid for simple elementary reactions, and foods are all but simple. Interactions in the food matrix and variability are 2 complicating factors. It is discussed how this difficulty can be tackled, and research priorities are suggested to come to better models in food science, and thereby to a better control of food quality.},

	abstract = {A two-compartment, heterogeneous population model (HPM) was derived using the simulation software SB ModelMaker© to describe the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in bacteriological media at 5–35 °C. The model assumed that, at time t = 0, the inoculum was distributed between two distinct compartments, Non-Growing and Growing, and that growth could be described by four parameters: initial total cell population (N0), final maximum cell population (Nmax), maximum specific growth rate (μmax), and initial cell population in the Growing compartment (G0). The model was fitted to the data by optimizing the four parameters, and lag phase duration (λ) was calculated. The resulting values of μmax and λ were similar to those determined using the modified Gompertz equation. A new parameter, w0 was defined which relates to the proportion of the initial cell population capable of growth, and is a measure of the initial physiological state of the cells. A modified model in which μmax was replaced with a temperature function, and w0 replaced G0, was used to predict the effect of temperature on the growth of L. monocytogenes. The results of this study raise questions concerning the current definition of the lag phase.},

	abstract = {The Arrhenius Law, which was originally proposed to describe the temperature dependence of the specific reaction rate constant in chemical reactions, does not adequately describe the effect of temperature on bacterial growth. Microbiologists have attempted to apply a modified version of this law to bacterial growth by replacing the reaction rate constant by the growth rate constant, but the modified law relationship fits data poorly, as graphs of the logarithm of the growth rate constant against reciprocal absolute temperature result in curves rather than straight lines. Instead, a linear relationship between in square root of growth rate constant (r) and temperature (T), namely, square root = b (T - T0), where b is the regression coefficient and T0 is a hypothetical temperature which is an intrinsic property of the organism, is proposed and found to apply to the growth of a wide range of bacteria. The relationship is also applicable to nucleotide breakdown and to the growth of yeast and molds.},

	abstract = {A method was developed to combine qualitative and quantitative information to predict possible growth of microorganisms in foods. The pH, water activity, temperature, and oxygen availability of foods are coupled to the growth characteristics of microorganisms. Therefore, a database with characteristics of foods and a database of kinetic parameters of microorganisms were built. In the first database, a tree structure based on physical similarity was built, for the case that information about the characteristics of a particular food is unknown. By comparing with similar products at the same level of the tree or the level above, the product information can be estimated. A method is developed to make an estimation of the microbial growth kinetics on the basis of models. This is done by introducing a growth factor, which can be calculated on the basis of readily available data from literature. Since all the information can be altered, the system can give better predictions when more and more accurate information is added.},
